In this poster presentation, we explore the fascinating world of folded two-dimensional (2D) materials, which represent an emerging frontier in materials science. Unlike planar 2D materials such as graphene and h-BN, folded 2D materials exhibit unique structural characteristics that lead to intriguing mechanical behaviors.
Our research focuses on three key aspects: 
- Defect mechanics and self-healing phenomena
- Structural phase transitions
- Novel geometric configurations leading to unusual mechanical properties
Using advanced computational methods including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate several interesting cases:
- Self-healing mechanisms in phosphorene
- Phase transformation behavior in phosphorene systems
- Three-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio in novel X3M2 crystals (X=S, Se; M=N, P, As)
This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in folded 2D materials and their potential applications in next-generation devices.
