We develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms for the efficient design and discovery of advanced materials and structures. Our research integrates deep learning architectures, physics-informed neural networks, and active learning strategies to accelerate materials development and optimization. These platforms enable inverse design capabilities, multi-property prediction, and process-structure-property relationship understanding across various material systems. Through innovative computational frameworks, we bridge the gap between materials science and artificial intelligence to enable rapid materials discovery and design.
