We develop innovative composite material designs inspired by biological systems to achieve superior fracture and fatigue resistance. Our research combines advanced computational modeling, theoretical analysis, and bio-inspired structural design principles to understand and enhance material performance under extreme conditions. Through systematic investigation of interface mechanisms, geometrical optimization, and damage evolution, we explore novel pathways to improve material durability and reliability.
